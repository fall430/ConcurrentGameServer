# ConcurrentGameServer
ConcurrentGameServer Server is a robust multithreaded game server designed to host multiple online Tic-Tac-Toe games concurrently. This project leverages advanced multithreading and socket programming techniques to efficiently manage multiple game sessions, ensuring a seamless and scalable multiplayer experience.

# Overview
In today's connected world, providing a responsive and scalable gaming experience is key to user engagement. ConcurrentGameServer Server demonstrates the power of concurrent programming by managing multiple Tic-Tac-Toe games simultaneously. The server ensures smooth gameplay by coordinating player actions, validating moves, and maintaining the game state in real time.

# Features
Multithreaded Game Management: Supports multiple concurrent game sessions, each managed independently to prevent lag and ensure fairness.
Dynamic Player Pairing: Automatically pairs players and assigns roles for new game sessions, adjusting dynamically to player availability.
Real-Time Updates: Provides immediate game state updates to connected players, enhancing the interactive experience.
Comprehensive Validation and Error Handling: Implements strict rules for move validation and robust error handling to maintain game integrity.
Scalable Server Design: Easily scales to support more players and games, showcasing the efficiency of concurrent server programming.

# How It Works
Server Initialization: The server (ttts) starts listening on a specified port for incoming player connections.
Player Management: As players connect, the server pairs them into game sessions and assigns roles (X or O).
Game Coordination: The server handles all game logic, including turn management, move validation, and game state updates.
Concurrency and Scalability: Each game session runs in its own thread, allowing the server to manage multiple games concurrently without performance issues.
